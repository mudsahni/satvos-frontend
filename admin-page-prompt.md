# SATVOS Admin Pages — Frontend Implementation Prompt

Add admin pages to the existing SATVOS Next.js + TypeScript frontend. These pages are **only visible to users with the `admin` role** and live under an `/admin` route group in the app. The regular user-facing pages (documents, collections, files, reports, dashboard) already exist — this is purely the admin control panel.

**All operations are scoped to the admin's own tenant** — the backend enforces this via the `tenant_id` in the JWT. There is no cross-tenant access.

All API responses use this envelope:
```typescript
interface APIResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: { code: string; message: string };
  meta?: { total: number; offset: number; limit: number };
}
```

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Pagination uses `?offset=0&limit=20` (max 100).

The JWT claims contain:
```typescript
interface JWTClaims {
  tenant_id: string;   // The admin's own tenant
  user_id: string;
  email: string;
  role: "admin";       // Will always be "admin" on these pages
}
```

---

## 1. Tenant Settings

**Route**: `/admin/settings`

Admins can view and edit their own tenant's details. There is no way to view or manage other tenants.

### 1.1 View Tenant

**API**: `GET /api/v1/admin/tenant`

Displays the admin's own tenant information as a read-only card with an "Edit" button.

```typescript
interface Tenant {
  id: string;          // UUID
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  is_active: boolean;
  created_at: string;  // ISO 8601
  updated_at: string;
}
```

**Display**:
- Organization Name
- Slug (read-only identifier)
- Status (Active/Inactive badge)
- Created date

### 1.2 Edit Tenant

**API**: `PUT /api/v1/admin/tenant`

```json
{ "name": "New Name", "slug": "new-slug", "is_active": false }
```

All fields optional (partial update).

**Form**:
- Name (text input)
- Slug (text input — validate: lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, no spaces)
- Active toggle with warning: "Deactivating prevents all users in this tenant from logging in"

**Error**: `DUPLICATE_SLUG` (409) — "This tenant slug is already taken"

---

## 2. User Management

**Route**: `/admin/users`

Admins manage users within their own tenant. The API automatically scopes all queries to the admin's tenant — there is no way to see or manage users from other tenants. Users are created by admins (except free-tier who self-register).

### 2.1 User List Page

**API**: `GET /api/v1/users?offset=0&limit=20` (admin only)

**Table columns**:
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Full Name | string | |
| Email | string | |
| Role | badge | Color-coded: admin (purple), manager (blue), member (teal), viewer (gray), free (green) |
| Status | badge | Active / Inactive |
| Email Verified | icon | Checkmark or X |
| Auth Provider | badge | `email` or `google` |
| Doc Usage | text | `documents_used_this_period / monthly_document_limit` (show for free users, "Unlimited" for others) |
| Created | date | |

**Filters** (client-side or future API): Role dropdown, Active/Inactive toggle

### 2.2 Create User

**API**: `POST /api/v1/users` (admin only)

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "min8chars",
  "full_name": "Jane Smith",
  "role": "member"
}
```

**Form**:
- Email (required, email format)
- Password (required, min 8 chars — show strength indicator)
- Full Name (required)
- Role (required, dropdown): `admin`, `manager`, `member`, `viewer`
  - Do NOT show `free` (self-registration only) or `service` (service accounts only) in this dropdown

**Error**: `DUPLICATE_EMAIL` (409) — "An account with this email already exists"

### 2.3 Edit User

**API**: `PUT /api/v1/users/:id` (admin access)

```json
{
  "email": "new@email.com",
  "full_name": "New Name",
  "role": "manager",
  "is_active": false
}
```

All fields optional. Show:
- **Role selector**: dropdown (admin, manager, member, viewer). Show warning when changing role: "Changing role affects this user's access to all collections"
- **Active toggle**: with warning "Deactivating prevents this user from logging in"
- **Email verified**: read-only display (cannot be manually set by admin)
- **Auth provider**: read-only (email or google)
- **Quota info** (for free users): `documents_used_this_period` / `monthly_document_limit`, period start date

### 2.4 View User Detail

**API**: `GET /api/v1/users/:id` (admin or self)

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  tenant_id: string;
  email: string;
  full_name: string;
  role: "admin" | "manager" | "member" | "viewer" | "free" | "service";
  is_active: boolean;
  monthly_document_limit: number;
  documents_used_this_period: number;
  current_period_start: string;
  email_verified: boolean;
  email_verified_at?: string;
  auth_provider: "email" | "google" | "api_key";
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### 2.5 Delete User

**API**: `DELETE /api/v1/users/:id` (admin only)

Confirmation dialog showing user name and email.

### 2.6 Role Hierarchy Reference

Display this in a help tooltip or info panel so the admin understands what each role grants:

| Role | Level | Implicit Collection Access | Key Capabilities |
|------|-------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| admin | 4 | Owner on ALL collections | Full control, user management, tenant settings, delete anything |
| manager | 3 | Editor on ALL collections | Upload, create/edit/validate docs, manage tags, cannot manage users |
| member | 2 | Viewer on ALL collections | Upload, create docs (with email verified), read access |
| viewer | 1 | None | Read-only, needs explicit collection grants to see anything |
| free | 0 | None | Self-registered, quota-limited, only personal collection |

---

## 3. Collection Permission Management

**Route**: `/admin/permissions` or accessible from collection detail pages

This is how admins control who can access which collections within their tenant. Admins have implicit owner access to all collections in their tenant, but viewer/free users need explicit grants.

### 3.1 View Collection Permissions

**API**: `GET /api/v1/collections/:id/permissions?offset=0&limit=20`

Returns permissions for a specific collection:

```typescript
interface CollectionPermissionEntry {
  id: string;
  collection_id: string;
  tenant_id: string;
  user_id: string;
  permission: "owner" | "editor" | "viewer";
  granted_by: string;   // UUID of granting user
  created_at: string;
}
```

**Display as table**:
| User | Email | Explicit Permission | Effective Permission | Granted By | Date |
|------|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|------|

Note: "Effective Permission" = `max(implicit_from_role, explicit_grant)`. So a `manager` user always has at least `editor` even without an explicit grant. Display both so the admin understands the distinction.

### 3.2 Grant / Change Permission

**API**: `POST /api/v1/collections/:id/permissions`

```json
{ "user_id": "uuid", "permission": "editor" }
```

**UI**: User picker (searchable dropdown of tenant users) + permission dropdown (`owner`, `editor`, `viewer`). If the user already has a grant, this upserts it.

Validate: target user must belong to the same tenant (backend enforces this).

### 3.3 Remove Permission

**API**: `DELETE /api/v1/collections/:id/permissions/:userId`

Cannot remove your own permission (backend returns `SELF_PERMISSION_REMOVAL`). Show confirmation dialog.

### 3.4 Bulk Permission View (Admin Overview)

Consider building an admin-only overview page that shows a matrix or list:
- All collections in the tenant (`GET /api/v1/collections`)
- Per collection, count of explicit permission grants
- Quick link to manage each collection's permissions

This helps admins answer: "Who has access to what?"

---

## 4. Service Account Management

**Route**: `/admin/service-accounts`

Service accounts are non-human API identities for programmatic access (ERP integrations, automation, batch processing). They authenticate via API keys, not JWT. Each service account belongs to the admin's own tenant.

### 4.1 Service Account List

**API**: `GET /api/v1/service-accounts?offset=0&limit=20` (admin only)

**Table columns**:
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Name | string | Account name |
| Description | string | Purpose description |
| Key Prefix | code | `sk_XXXXXXXX...` (first 8 chars for identification) |
| Status | badge | Active (green) / Revoked (red) |
| Last Used | date | `last_used_at` — shows when the key was last used for an API call |
| Expires | date | `expires_at` — null = never expires |
| Created | date | |

### 4.2 Create Service Account

**API**: `POST /api/v1/service-accounts`

```json
{
  "name": "ERP Integration",
  "description": "Uploads invoices from Tally ERP",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"   // optional, RFC3339
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "service_account": { ...ServiceAccount },
  "api_key": "sk_<64-hex-chars>"
}
```

**CRITICAL UX**: The raw API key is returned **only once**. After creation, display:
- The full key in a monospace read-only field
- A "Copy to clipboard" button
- A warning banner: "Save this API key now. It will not be shown again."
- A checkbox or button: "I've saved this key" that must be confirmed before dismissing

**Form**:
- Name (required)
- Description (optional)
- Expiry date (optional date picker — leave blank for no expiry)

### 4.3 Service Account Detail

**API**: `GET /api/v1/service-accounts/:id`

```typescript
interface ServiceAccount {
  id: string;
  tenant_id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  api_key_prefix: string;   // "sk_XXXXXXXX" — first 8 chars
  is_active: boolean;
  created_by: string;       // UUID
  last_used_at?: string;
  expires_at?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

**Sections on detail page**:

1. **Info card**: Name, description, key prefix, status, creator, last used, expiry
2. **Key actions**: Rotate Key, Revoke (see below)
3. **Collection permissions** (see 4.5)

### 4.4 Key Management Actions

**Rotate Key**: `POST /api/v1/service-accounts/:id/rotate-key`
- Generates a new API key, immediately invalidates the old one
- Response includes new key — show with same "save it now" UX as creation
- Confirmation dialog: "The current key will stop working immediately"

**Revoke**: `POST /api/v1/service-accounts/:id/revoke`
- Deactivates the service account. All API calls with this key will fail
- Confirmation dialog: "This service account will be deactivated. Any integrations using this key will break."

**Delete**: `DELETE /api/v1/service-accounts/:id`
- Permanent deletion. Confirmation dialog.

### 4.5 Service Account Permissions

Service accounts have **no implicit collection access** (unlike regular users whose role grants implicit access). All access must be explicitly granted.

**List**: `GET /api/v1/service-accounts/:id/permissions`

```typescript
interface ServiceAccountPermission {
  id: string;
  service_account_id: string;
  collection_id: string;
  tenant_id: string;
  permission: "owner" | "editor" | "viewer";
  granted_by: string;
}
```

**Grant**: `POST /api/v1/service-accounts/:id/permissions`
```json
{ "collection_id": "uuid", "permission": "editor" }
```

**Remove**: `DELETE /api/v1/service-accounts/:id/permissions/:collectionId`

**Display**: Table of granted collections with name, permission level, and remove button. "Add Collection" button opens a collection picker + permission dropdown.

### 4.6 Service Account Restrictions

Display these as an info box on the service accounts page so admins understand the boundaries:
- Cannot log into the UI (API key auth only)
- Cannot review documents (approve/reject)
- Cannot be assigned documents for review
- Cannot create collections
- Cannot manage users or tenants
- Can only access collections with explicit permission grants
- File listing filtered to files uploaded by this service account

## 5. Admin Overview Dashboard

**Route**: `/admin` (admin landing page)

**APIs**: `GET /api/v1/admin/tenant`, `GET /api/v1/stats`, `GET /api/v1/users?limit=1`, `GET /api/v1/service-accounts?limit=1`

Show the current tenant name as a page header (from `GET /api/v1/admin/tenant`).

**Cards**:
- Total Users (link to user list) — from users list `meta.total`
- Total Collections — from `stats.total_collections`
- Total Service Accounts (link to SA list) — from service accounts list `meta.total`
- Documents with Parsing Failures (`stats.parsing_failed`) — link to documents filtered by failed
- Documents Pending Review (`stats.review_pending`) — link to documents
- Validation Issues (`stats.validation_invalid + stats.validation_warning`)

---

## 6. Navigation

Add an "Admin" section to the existing sidebar, **visible only when `user.role === "admin"`**:

```
Admin
├── Overview              → /admin
├── Tenant Settings       → /admin/settings
├── Users                 → /admin/users
├── Service Accounts      → /admin/service-accounts
└── Permissions           → /admin/permissions
```

Display the current tenant name in the sidebar header or as a subtitle under "Admin" (fetch from `GET /api/v1/admin/tenant`). This reinforces that all admin pages are scoped to the admin's own organization.

---

## 7. Shared Admin Components

### UserPicker
Searchable dropdown to select a user from the tenant. Fetch from `GET /api/v1/users?limit=100`. Display as `Full Name (email)`. Used in: permission grants, assignment.

### CollectionPicker
Searchable dropdown for collections. Fetch from `GET /api/v1/collections?limit=100`. Display as collection name with document count. Used in: service account permissions.

### ConfirmDialog
Reusable confirmation modal. Variants:
- **Standard**: "Are you sure?" with Cancel/Confirm
- **Destructive**: Red-themed with type-to-confirm for dangerous operations (delete user)

### StatusBadge
Colored badge for statuses. Use consistently:
- Active / green
- Inactive / Revoked / red
- Role badges with role-specific colors (see 2.1)

---

## 8. Error Handling for Admin Pages

Map these backend error codes to admin-friendly messages:

| Code | HTTP | Message |
|------|------|---------|
| `DUPLICATE_EMAIL` | 409 | "A user with this email already exists in this tenant" |
| `DUPLICATE_SLUG` | 409 | "This tenant slug is already taken" |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | "Resource not found" |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | "You don't have permission for this action" |
| `INSUFFICIENT_ROLE` | 403 | "This action requires a higher role" |
| `SELF_PERMISSION_REMOVAL` | 400 | "You cannot remove your own permission" |
| `INVALID_PERMISSION` | 400 | "Permission must be: owner, editor, or viewer" |
| `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | "Service account not found" |
| `TENANT_INACTIVE` | 403 | "This tenant is deactivated" |
| `USER_INACTIVE` | 403 | "This user account is deactivated" |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | "Something went wrong. Please try again." |

---
