# Backend URL — used by the middleware proxy at runtime (NOT baked at build time)
# The client sends requests to /api/v1/* (relative), and the middleware
# rewrites them to BACKEND_URL/api/v1/* on the server.
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Optional: override the API base URL used by the browser directly
# (bypasses the proxy — only needed if the browser should call the backend directly)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/v1
